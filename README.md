#  Introduction
Hello my name is Mikey Murata, and I am 15 years old. I am a student at Chatsworth Charter High School and I am in the 10th grade. I play on the basketball team at our school as well as the volleyball team. I enjoy playing both of these sports along with other things like playing video games on my PC at home. I have two siblings, an older brother and an older sister, both of which attended Chatsworth too.I struggled last year in Computer Science Principles but I am hoping to be able to get an A in this class this year.
